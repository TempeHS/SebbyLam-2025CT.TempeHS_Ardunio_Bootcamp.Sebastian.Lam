  Learning Intention:
  The students will learn how to connect and control a servo motor.

  Success Criteria:
    1.  I understand how to connect the servo motor
    2.  I can manually write different degrees of movement to the servo
    3.  I can map a potentiometer to a servo and control its movement
    4.  I understand that a 180deg servo angle of movement is set by a
        frequency signal sent from the microcontroller

  Student Notes:
